About how long did you and your partners (if any) spend on this project?

21 hours

What was the hardest part about this project?

They were many parts that took us some time to debug and figure out how to do right. One of them is the Catmull-Roll Curve and getting the Particle System right. 

Is there anything you would change about this project?

I would definitely add a little more detail in the explanation that would help us to handle and work on the project.
